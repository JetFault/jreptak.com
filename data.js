The current project I'm working on is called City Beat. It's an awesome project easily explained as \"Real-time Analytics for the City\". We're using Instagram and Twitter to find events (such as fires, concerts, sports games) from social media before journalists can! A past project I worked on is called <a href='http://sm.rutgers.edu/thebeat' target='_blank'>The Beat</a>. It mashed up Instagram pictures with the Google Streetview location of where that picture was taken. It went viral and I got some really awesome comments about it.",
